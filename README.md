# Personal Web Clone v2

## Overview
This project is a responsive website cloned from the [Start Bootstrap Personal template](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/personal). The implementation uses SCSS for enhanced styling capabilities and includes custom-built components such as buttons, cards, and other UI elements.

This is the second version of the project. The previous version ([Link github](https://github.com/thangvb168/personal-web-clone)) was built using pure CSS, while this version leverages SCSS for improved maintainability and organization.

## Features
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Custom SCSS implementation
- Hand-built components (buttons, cards, etc.)
